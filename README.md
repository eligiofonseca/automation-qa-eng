## Introduction

In the realm of software development, automated testing plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of our applications. This repository serves as a central hub for our QA engineers to develop, maintain, and execute automated test suites using industry-standard testing frameworks.

## Features

- **Test Frameworks:** Utilize a variety of testing frameworks such as:
  - [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
  - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
 - etc....
- **Test Cases:** Comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios and functionalities of the application.
- **Reusable Components:** Encapsulated functions, utilities, and page objects for code reusability and maintainability.
- **Integration:** Seamless integration with Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines for automated testing on each code change.
